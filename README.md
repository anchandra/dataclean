Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project


This repository contains run_analysis.R which uses data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and does the following:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5.From the data set in step 4,creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Final tidy data is saved as averages_dataset.txt.


The CodeBook.md file has description of the resulting data and variables.
